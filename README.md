# Introduction

This Julia code is a complement to the article 

#### [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877) : "Rigorous computation of solutions of semi-linear PDEs on unbounded domains via spectral methods", M. Cadiot, J-P. Lessard and J-C. Nave, [ArXiv Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877)

as it provides the necessary rigorous computations that are needed in Section 6. The rigorous computations are performed using the package [IntervalArithmetic](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl). The mathematical objects (spaces, sequences, operators,...) are built using the package [RadiiPolynomial](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/RadiiPolynomial.jl). 


# The Kawahara equation

The Kawahara equation
$$\lambda_2u'''' + \lambda_1u'' + u + \lambda_3u^2 = 0$$
is known to have solutions on $\mathbb{R}$ that decay to zero at infinity. These solutions are called solitary waves or soliton (see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877) for a complete description).

## Proof of solitons

The present code provides the rigorous numerics for the proof of solitons of the Kawahara equation using the analysis of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877) (specifically the Section 6). The user can choose, line 504 of the code, the values for N, d, T and c, that are described in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877). In particular, T and c need to be chosen such that
 - $0 \leq T < 0.397$ 
 - $c < 1- \frac{a(T)^2}{4b(T)}$    
where
- $a(T) = \frac{1-3T}{6}$
- $b(T) = \frac{19 - 30T - 45T^2}{360}$.   

The code will compute rigorously the needed bounds of Section 6 of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877) and validate of not the computer-assisted proof. If the computer-assisted proof succeeds, the radius for the smallest and biggest ball of contraction is displayed.

## Proof of the first 3 eigencouples

If the proof of the soliton is achieved, the code will then compute approximations for the first 3 eigencouples of the linearization around the proved soliton. Then, the needed bounds for the proof of eigencouples are computed, following the analysis of Section 6 of [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877). In particular, the proof will be valid if T was chosen such that
 $\frac{1}{3} < T < 0.397$. 
  
   

 If the computer-assisted proof succeeds, the radius for the smallest and biggest ball of contraction is displayed for each eigencouple.
 
 
 ## Proof of orbital stability

If the proof of the first 3 eigencouples is achieved, the code will then try to prove Theorem 6.20 in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12877). In particular, we want to prove that the 3 eigenvalues obtained beforehead, are actually the first 3 ones. The algorithm is explained in the proof of Theorem 6.20 and uses Lemma 6.19. 

 If the computer-assisted proof of Theorem 6.20 succeeds, the value for  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\tau" /> (Proposition 6.23) is computed rigorously. In particular, we check that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\tau" /> is striclty negative, and if that is the case, then we obtain that the proved soliton is orbitally stable.
 
 
 # Utilisation and References
 
 Go directly to line 504 of the code in order to enter the values for N, d, c and T. The values need to respect the requirements cited above. I would suggest to keep the by-default values of N and d. However, if the proof fails, you can try to increase the value of d and N. This can happen if you choose values of c and T that are close to singular values (bifurcation points) such as $c =1$ or $T = \frac{1}{3}$.
 
 The code is build using the following packages :
 - [RadiiPolynomial](https://github.com/OlivierHnt/RadiiPolynomial.jl) 
 - [IntervalArithmetic](https://github.com/JuliaIntervals/IntervalArithmetic.jl)
 - [LinearAlgebra](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/)
 - [FFTW](https://github.com/JuliaMath/FFTW.jl)
 - [PrettyTables](https://ronisbr.github.io/PrettyTables.jl/stable/).
 
 You will need to install these packages. After that, you should be able to run the code normally.
